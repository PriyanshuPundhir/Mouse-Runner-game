# Mouse-Runner-game
## In game screen shots
## It is the first 3D game I ever made. It was made using unity game engine. In this game the main player/character had to collect apple to score point , red apple gives 1 point and green apple gives 5 points. We also have to save our player from touching fence or falling into water, if we fail to do so gave will be over. Player had to collect 15 points in total to finish and win the game. After the game is over we could restart it or we could exit it. It also has a party trick, when we press R key on our key board the character will show some dance moves.
